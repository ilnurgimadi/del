# Major scientific achievements during last five years
## Scientific achievements:
During undergraduate studies I began to participate in the research work. Up to this day 7 articles have been published. These studies were done using methods such as: electron paramagnetic resonance, non-resonant microwave absorption, AC susceptibility, AC and DC electrical transport measurements. The problems studied over the last 5 years are summarized below:
- Study of the demagnetizing field effect on the ESR spectra of the thin ferromagnetic and paramagnetic films. The temperature dependence of the demagnetizing field and the parameters of the Curie-Weiss law are obtained. The results are published in the “Magnetic Resonance in Solids” Electronic Journal 17, 2, 15203 (2015). My specific contribution: designing and preforming the experiment; interpreting the data. 
- The superconducting fluctuations (SCF) and charge density waves (CDW) above the critical temperature in сuprate superconductors were studied with the help of microwave absorption (MWA) experiments.  The boundaries of areas with SCF and CDW are plotted on the phase diagram using the variation of the MWA temperature dependence with the hole density. The results of the work are published in journals: Applied Magnetic Resonance 48, 861 (2017); JETP Letters 108, 675 (2018). My specific contribution: designing and preforming the experiment; interpreting the data.
- Iron chalcogenides have been investigated to reveal the magnetic and nematic fluctuations. The comparison of the microwave absorption data and the resistivity versus temperature made it possible to separate the contributions of two types of fluctuations: anisotropic magnetic and isotropic. The results of the work are published in journals: JETP 129, 1, 81 (2019); Magnetic Resonance in Solids 21, 19305 (2019). My specific contribution: designing and preforming the experiment; interpreting the data.

# Technical developments achievements:
At the beginning of scientific activity new challenges and opportunities motivate me to upgrade existing measuring systems and create new equipment in the laboratory. As a result, several measuring probes were created for measuring high-frequency magnetic susceptibility, transport properties with direct and alternating current, and the cryogenic system with pumping out liquid helium vapor was developed. In order to automate measuring processes, I have developed the universal measuring program that combines all measuring instruments into one system. This measuring complex participated in the implementation of the grants: Foundation for Assistance to Small Innovative Enterprises #13712/2018 (2019); Investment and Venture Fund of the Republic of Tatarstan #13/109/2019 (2019). My specific contribution: design of the new instruments and software development.
